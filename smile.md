Smile

Music by Charles Chaplin, Lyrics by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons

Smile, though your heart is aching  
Smile, even though it’s breaking  
When there are clouds in the sky  
you’ll get by  
If you smile through your fear and sorrow  
Smile and maybe tomorrow  
You’ll see the sun come shining through  
for you  

Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear may be ever so near  
That’s the time you must keep on trying  
Smile what’s the use of crying  
You’ll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you’ll just  
Smile
